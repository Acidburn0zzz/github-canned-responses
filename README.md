# github-canned-responses

Sometimes you've made mistakes and you have to triage 700 GitHub issues and Pull Requests. A lot of them will need the same answer, and your wrists will start hurting from all the switch-to-edit-copy-pasting. This extension helps with that.

## How to get it
[Install it from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-canned-responses/lhehmppafakahahobaibfcomknkhoina)

[Install it from the Firefox Add-on Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/github-canned-responses/) -- note that editing/adding new answers doesn't work yet on Firefox. Stay tuned!

## What is it
The extension adds a little button inside GitHub's
comment editing view, that allows you to choose one of the existing canned responses, and insert it in the current comment. It looks like this, and it works on both Issues and PRs pages (but at the moment not the `files` view of a PR):

## Adding your own canned responses
The extension comes with a few default canned responses, but you can edit them and add your own! Currently (Feb 1) this is supported only in Chrome (go to `chrome://extensions`, scroll down until you find the extension, and click on the "Options" link). An inside-of-the-GitHub-editing-page version is coming soon. In the meantime, you'll get something that looks like this:

## Happy triaging, friends! <3
