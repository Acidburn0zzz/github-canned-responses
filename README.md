# github-canned-responses

Sometimes you've made mistakes and you have to triage 700 GitHub issues and Pull Requests. A lot of them will need the same answer, and your wrists will start hurting from all the switch-to-edit-copy-pasting. This extension helps with that.

[Install it from the Chrome Web Store]()!

The extension adds a little "canned response" button inside the
comment editing view, that allows you to filter through existing
canned responses.

It comes with a few default canned responses, but you can edit them and add your own!

Happy triaging, friends! <3
