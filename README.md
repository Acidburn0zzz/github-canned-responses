# github-canned-responses

Sometimes you've made mistakes and you have to triage 700 GitHub issues and Pull Requests. A lot of them will need the same answer, and your wrists will start hurting from all the switch-to-edit-copy-pasting. This extension helps with that.

[Install it from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-canned-responses/lhehmppafakahahobaibfcomknkhoina)!

The extension adds a little "canned response" button inside the
comment editing view, that allows you to filter through existing
canned responses. It looks like this, and it works on both Issues and PRs pages (but at the moment not the `files` view of a PR):

Clicking the button will give you a filterable view with all your canned answers:

)

## Adding your own canned answers
The extension comes with a few default canned responses, but you can edit them and add your own! (To do so,
  go to `chrome://extensions`, scroll down until you find the extension, and click on the "Options" link). You'll get something that looks like this:

Happy triaging, friends! <3
